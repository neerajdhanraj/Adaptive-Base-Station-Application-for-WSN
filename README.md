# Adaptive-Base-Station-Application-for-WSN
Dynamic base station for Wireless sensor network application, which highly capable to adapt itself for any other application in WSN.

-Dear Friends,
 -This application is a dynamic base station for Wireless sensor network application, which highly capable to adapt itself for any other application in WSN. The proposed base station system has more memory, higher processing and communication capabilities. This system is able to query sensor data, process them, store them and deliver that data to user's cell phone, instantly. The base station system is built around ARM11 architecture microcontroller with Windows Embedded CE 6.0 (Still, it can be used in any Windows OS based hardware), so that it could possess good processing power, reliability, user friendly GUI and security. For communication purpose, IEEE802.15.4 based ZigBee RF module and GSM modem are used. The data received by base station is processed and stored in memory. The application of Base station is dynamic and customizable. User can change it easily as per the experimental or research requirements.
